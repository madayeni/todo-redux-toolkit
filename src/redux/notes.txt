0. Installing react-redux and redux-toolkit
1. Making a redux folder
2. Inside that, making a store.js file
3. write the boilerplate: configurestore and reducer
4. bringing store and provider in index.js and wrap App by provider
5. Creating a slice: name, initial state, reducers
6. export by name each action as reducer and export default reducer
7. attach reducer to store
8. Whenever we want to do something (like adding, deleting) dispatch the corresponding action useDispatch
9. Then the reducer receives the action with the payload and update the state accordingly
10. useSelector to get the state from the store
11. for more actions (functionalities), we repeat previous steps
12. for more states, we repeat the previous states
